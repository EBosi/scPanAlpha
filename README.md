# Repository of the manuscript "The gene signatures of human alpha cells in types 1 and 2 diabetes indicate disease-specific pathways of alpha cell dysfunction"
In this repository I've loaded the scripts and resources used in the paper "The gene signatures of human alpha cells in types 1 and 2 diabetes indicate disease-specific pathways of alpha cell dysfunction", currently under revision.
Importantly, since a number of files are large and would exceed the github quota, I loaded part of the input/intermediate data on [figshare](https://figshare.com/account/home#/data).
The code is reported in a narrative way using ipython notebooks. The two main notebooks are:
- QC, where data quality is diagnosed and threshold to flag low-quality cells are defined.
- Main, where the data is filtered and cells are clustered/annotated.
